# Titanic Dataset

The goal of this initial project was use the titanic dataset available on Kaggle to familiarize myself with the following tools to perform EDA, data cleaning, and preliminary model development:

1. PostgresSQL
2. Python and Pandas
3. Scipy.stats 
4. Matplotlib 
5. Seaborn
6. Sklearn preprocessing methods LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, and StandardScaler.  

My preliminary model had an accuracy of 0.79.

The original source of the data is https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
